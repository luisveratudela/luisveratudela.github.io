Hi there,

I am Luis and I don't like about me pages. So here we go.

My current research interest is on decision making. Particularly I focus on mental models.

I always enjoyed humanities, technology and sports in equal terms.

Now I look at them from the perspective of quantitative, qualitative and mental models.

Probably, right now I am reading or writing something I learn about.
