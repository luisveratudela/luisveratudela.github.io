# Staying focused
---

Latest research on decision making indicates that we humans are not so rational as we have thought. That makes sense, since we evolved to survive, no to be rational.

Humans evolved biologically and culturally. But cultural evolution is faster than biological evolution. In our modern society many people assume that we are more rational than we really are.

I look at decision making from the eyes of a modeller, so to me it seems as a three step process: input selection, model construction and output generation. The speed needed for a decision would trigger two different processes.

If it must be fast, we take decisions based on preconceptions. Survival takes precedence. But, sometimes we are not aware of the preconceptions we use. So the risk is not on the preconceptions themselves, but on not being aware of them.

If time is sufficient, we tend to reflect upon reality and try to make such decision following a rational path. But most of the time we took already a decision based on intuition and spend most of the time building a good narrative.
