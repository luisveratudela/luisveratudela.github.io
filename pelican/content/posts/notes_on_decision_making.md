# Notes on decision making
---

I discovered my passion about decision making while carrying out my PhD research. Many times I found myself answering one question: why was I pursuing a PhD while I seemed to be in the mid of a successful career?

Researchers endure long strikes of frustration, and I wasn't going to be the exception. That motivated me to review my own thinking process. So, after repeating my answer many times to family and friends, I started questioning myself why did I make such decision.

In philosophy of science you talk about the _cognitive basis of model-based reasoning_. In psychology you refer to _self-awareness_. Spiritual people call it the difference between _Self_ and your _Ego_. Looking at the connection of different sources of knowledge is what sparked my interest.

My investigation was on data science and wind turbines. To fill the gap between building hypothesis with data and making decisions based on new insights, I researched about decision making. At the end of my research I described it as applied decision making in wind energy using data science.

After completing my PhD I chose to go back to the industry over pursuing and academic path. Right now, nurturing my curiosity around decision making improves my daily work. This site should grow as a collection of notes, where I will curate information about applied decision making.
