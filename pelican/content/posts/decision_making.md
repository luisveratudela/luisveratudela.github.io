# Why decision making
---

I discovered my passion about decision making while carrying out my PhD research.

My investigation was on data science and wind turbines. But, to tailor the outcome I researched about decision making.

Building models for decision making soon trascended to other fields as I reflected on past experiences.

Reading scientific articles on quantiative analysis for financial investment decisions followed soon after.

I decided to combine my skills by managing my own investment portfolio.

Investigating quantitative and qualitative models became my second nature.

This site is a collection of personal notes on decision making.
