# How I built this website
---

I wanted to create my own website, so first I tried [Joomla](https://www.joomla.org/) next to my hosting provider [Strato](https://www.strato.com/). Not long before I had created an ecommerce store with [Wix](https://www.wix.com/) and a website with [Jimdo](www.jimdo.com), but this time I wanted full control.

After some hands-on time with Joomla and reading about [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/), I found CMS an overkill for the site in mind. So I turned to static website generators.

Since I code on Python and I am familiar with Markdown, I found [Pelican](https://blog.getpelican.com/) very appealing to my needs. 

After I came accross with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), I decided to host it from my own repository. Researching a bit, I found this step-by-step [guide](https://pythonforundergradengineers.com/how-i-built-this-site-1.html) very useful.

The repository of this website is available in [GitHub.](https://github.com/luisveratudela/luisveratudela.github.io)
